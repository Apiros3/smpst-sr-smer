## Software Requirements

1. **opam** – Package manager for OCaml  
   Install by following the instructions [here](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/1.1/Quick_Install.html).
2. **coqc 8.20.0** – Coq compiler  
    - Run in the terminal: `opam pin add coq 8.20.0`
3. **coqide** – Integrated development environment for Coq <br>
    - Run in the terminal: `opam install coqide`
4. **ssreflect** – Coq library for formalized mathematics <br>
    - Run in the terminal:
    ```bash
    opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
    opam install coq-mathcomp-ssreflect
5. **paco** – Coq library for implementing parametrized coinduction <br>
    - Run in the terminal:
    ```bash
    opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released 
    opam install coq-paco

## Shell Instructions

1. Fetch the code from [here](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/smpst-sr-smer-4563/README.md).
2. Open a terminal.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the code using the `cd` command.
4. Run: `eval $(opam env)` to update the shell environment for Coq.
5. Run: `coq_makefile -f _CoqProject -o Makefile` to generate the Makefile.
6. Run: `make` to compile the library (this may take up to 2 minutes). A successful compilation indicates that all results hold.

## Exploring Proofs in CoqIDE
- After the compilation is finished, you can open and explore the proof files using CoqIDE. 
- For instance, you can run (inside the directory containing the code) `coqide lemma/main.v` to open the `main.v` file and step through the proofs interactively.
- Refer to the [documentation](https://coq.inria.fr/doc/V8.18.0/refman/practical-tools/coqide.html) for instructions on managing code using CoqIDE.
